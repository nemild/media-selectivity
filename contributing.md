# Contributing
We welcome all those interested in contributing to this analysis of media selectivity. We’ve listed out a few concrete ways you can help with a focus on data collection, categorization, and analysis.

While many of the ways to contribute will appeal to hackers, engineers, data scientists, there are a number of tasks that don’t require such specialized skills.

Ways to help:

1.	Determine the amount of coverage the same event will get in different communities/countries; this will require looking at various sources in the days after an event happens. Examples include

	A.	Terrorism<br/>
	B.	Drone Strikes (especially one with civilian fatalities)<br/>
	C.	Hate crimes against a specific ethnic group (a US anti-Muslim attack’s coverage/sharing in the US versus its coverage/sharing in Saudi Arabia)<br/>
	D.	Natural disaster<br/>
	E.	US spying of other countries vs. other countries spying on the US

2.	Assemble media coverage data for other sources: One key critique of our analysis is that we’ve chosen a single data source – while conjecturing that the bias found there is found in all forms of media. Help collect and categorize content over a time period for any other media source of your choosing including:

	A.	Any publication in other regions of the world (e.g., Times of India, Le Monde)<br/>
	B.	Your Facebook feed<br/>
	C.	Your Twitter feed<br/>
	D.	Any industry publication<br/>
	E.	(For coders, you can build an automated data crawler – and for others, you can manually record)

3.	Identify and assemble a form of objective data to compare media coverage to: Our analysis uses only a few forms of objective data (national population/wealth statistics and deaths) – and media bias can be teased out further by comparing to other forms of objective data that you can assemble
4.	Look at extent of coverage of certain events; for example, see what percentage of articles were about the 2016 US Presidential election vs. all other topics
5.	Apply sentiment analysis to media coverage: Our analysis looks at article counts – and neglects a key part which is the content itself, such as the tone of coverage; for example, there exists widely used metrics to determine how partisan a media source is
6.	Develop a method to “unbias” your favorite media source of choice or measure the various “food pyramid” proportions; take a biased source, and create a method that would reduce the bias, however you define it
7.	Identify and help correct mistakes in our analysis: This analysis was created by one person working over several weeks – and required a substantial amount of judgment; point out mistakes and/or ways to improve further
